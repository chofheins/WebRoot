                        w3Schools is a great resource as an introduction to nearly 
                        all things needed to know in order to author good web pages.
                        This is valluable because there are a lot of tutorials and 
                        examples of web languages, including HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, SQL,
                        JSON, Node. Anyone working on the web will find this a 
                        valuable resource for authoring web apps. I can use this
                        site as a resource to look up the things i need as well as 
                        working through tutorials to learn new things, as well as 
                        refreshing what I have forgotten.<br />

                        dribbble is a great site to search for that spark of inspiration.
                        You have access to thousands of projects done by other web and graphic designers 
                        that showcase what is possible with todays resources. I can use this site to 
                        get inspiration for my own projects as well as a place to post some of my own
                        ideas.<br />

                        logomakr is a free logo creation website that I personally use as a resource 
                        to find high quality .png files to use as navigation and design elements 
                        within my personal web pages. I find using this website over something like 
                        google images gives me a lot more clipart style results which I find easier to
                        manipulate and customize. I also don't need to worry about copyright as it is 
                        free. The 'makr' portion of the site could be more feature rich but I prefer to 
                        just input the .png files into photoshop and use that instead anyway.<br />

                        As a developer you can never have to many tutorial sites in your arsenal. w3Schools
                        is a great resource but sometimes I think that they could use more than 1 example 
                        for a topic, thats where MDN comes in. MDN is a lot like w3Schools but differs in 
                        the way they explain topics. Often they go into more detail than W3 on specific 
                        topics.<br />

                        In my mind stackoverflow is a necessary evil. Sometimes its your only option especially 
                        when attempting to debug, which is primarily when I find myself using stackoverflow. 
                        If you have a question stackoverflow usually has an answer, the issue is that answer 
                        can often be outdated, inefficient, or straight up wrong. Because of this I always make 
                        sure to test stackoverflow answers in a seperate ide from my main one. I often use the 
                        w3Schools online "try it" tool for this.

                        Sometimes the best starting point when you don't know exactly what you need to accomplish 
                        your goal is a youtube video. Youtube offers countless coding tutorial videos for one to 
                        reference and learn from. Personally, I like to use youtube when I am just starting a project 
                        or assignment to get a review of basic material, and then use that knowledge as a guide to 
                        further research on sites like w3Schools.
